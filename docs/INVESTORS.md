## Executive Summary

The **Red Team Arsenal** (Sovereign Edition) is a production-grade AI Adversarial Emulation platform. It combines autonomous agent orchestration with offensive security mastery to provide enterprises with real-time, self-healing security architectures.

**We are closing the gap between AI vulnerability and enterprise safety through a research-driven, "Attack-to-Defend" paradigm.**

## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

As enterprises move towards autonomous agent workflows, the attack surface expands exponentially. Traditional security tools are too slow to counter AI-driven threats. The "Infinite Context" problem leads to reasoning drift and exfiltration risks that cost billions in intellectual property loss.
