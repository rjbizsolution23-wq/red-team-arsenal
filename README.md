## 🎯 Overview

The **Red Team Arsenal** is more than a security tool—it is a **Self-Healing AI Immune System**. In an era where adversarial AI moves at machine speed, traditional human-led red teaming is insufficient. This platform leverages a proprietary multi-agent hive mind to emulate complex adversarial campaigns, identify critical vulnerabilities across 52 industries, and write autonomous remediation patches in seconds.

Designed for **Enterprise CTOs**, **Venture Capitalists**, and **National Security Research**, the Arsenal provides a defensive moat that turns vulnerabilities into managed assets.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Autonomous Remediation Engine**: Not just finding bugs, but *fixing* them instantly with vetted code patches.
- **MITRE ATT&CK v15 Mapping**: Every finding is dynamically mapped to the global gold standard of adversarial techniques.
- **Stealth C2 Malleable Profiles**: Advanced traffic obfuscation to simulate elite state-level actors.
- **Offensive Guardrails**: Zero-tolerance safety layer to protect institutional targets (.gov, .mil) during audits.
- **Investor-Grade Observability**: Real-time dashboards showing security ROI and risk mitigation metrics.
